            <p>Hi! I'm Derek Keene, a passionate game developer and creative technologist with over 8 years of experience in the gaming industry. I started my career as a curious self-taught programmer and have since evolved into a full-stack game developer with expertise in multiple game engines and programming languages. My mission is to help aspiring game developers navigate the exciting landscape of game development and share the lessons I've learned along the way.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I've worked on indie projects, collaborated with studios, and tackled diverse game development challenges across multiple genres. From tower defence mechanics to open-world systems, I believe in creating engaging gameplay experiences that challenge and delight players. When I'm not coding or writing blog posts, you can find me playtesting new games, experimenting with game design mechanics, or exploring emerging technologies in game development.</p>

            <p>I created this blog to share my knowledge, insights, and experiences with the game development community. Whether you're just starting your game development journey or looking to deepen your expertise, I hope my articles provide value and inspiration. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on exciting gaming projects.</p>
